Webdesignwill.co.uk
======
Webdesignwill is being designed and built with full scalability in mind. The idea of the project is to build a site on a platform which I can use over and over again to build optimised and scalable front end applications. Webdesignwill is being built with all platforms in mind and in such a way that it is easy to decouple packages and modules for ease of team development.

The Dream
------
The end goal is to have a scalable website and light weight simple CMS that is served from a Node server communicating with a Mongo DB. The entire front end is built as an application that can be used across all platforms easily and support all major modern browsers.

Although Webdesignwill is a small application, some of the working ideas here are being developed on larger applications currently in the marketplace and are working very successfully.

Stay Tuned
